========

This module moves your standard log in page to login/direct/ and places at its
previous location (user/) a redirect to the configured OpenID Provider.


OpenID SSO
==========

OpenID based Simple Sign-On among trusted sites.

Add a trusted Drupal OpenID provider to a Drupal site. Users enjoy a simplified
sign on process between trusted sites.

Assumes that the OpenID Provider in place is a Drupal site with OpenID Provider
SSO module enabled.

Note: this module does not provide true *Single* Sign-On functionality but a
largely simplified sign on experience for webs of trusted sites. Hence the name
*Simple* Sign-On.


Installation
============

In your site's settings.php file, define a trusted OpenID Provider. OpenID

);
